### Detailed Features

#### Web

##### <i>Framework for backend</i>
We used Django for our backend development.

##### <i>Framework for front-end</i>
We used Bootstrap toolkit in addition of the vanilla Javascript for our frontend

##### <i>Database for backend</i>
We used a database for our backend. The database itself is PostgresSQL.

##### <i>Blockchain</i>
We store the tournament scores on a blockchain. The blockchain is Ethereum and the language used for smart contract development is Solidity. 

#### User Management

##### <i>Standard user management</i>
Users can subscribe to the website and registered users can log in in a secure way. Users can select a unique display name to play the tournaments. They can update their information, upload an avatar (there is a default avatar if they don't provide one), add others as friends and view their online status. User profiles display stats (their wins and losses) and each user has a match history. 

##### <i>Remote authentication</i>
Implementation of the following system: OAuth 2.0 authentication with 42.

#### Gameplay and user experience 

##### <i>Remote players</i>
It is possible for two players, using two different computers, to access the website and play pong together. Network issues have been taken into account.

##### <i>Multiple players</i>
Pong can be played by 2 or 4 players.

##### <i>Another game</i>
It is possible to play another game than pong : connect 4. There is an history and players can join a game by using the matchmaking system. 

#### AI-Algo

##### <i>AI opponent</i>
It is possible to play against an AI in the CLI (Command-Line Interface).

#### Cybersecurity

##### <i>GDPR</i>
We are compliant with the GDPR. Users are able to request anonymization of their personal data, which ensure that their identity and sensitive information are protected. They can also view, edit or delete their personal information stored within the system. They can request the permanent deletion fo their account.

##### <i>2FA</i>
We implemented Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and we utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as a secure method for authentication and authorization.

#### Devops

##### <i>ELK</i>
We established a robust infrastructure for log management and analysis using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

##### <i>Monitoring system</i>
We set up a monitoring system using Prometheus and Grafana.

##### <i>Backend as microservices</i>
The backend follows microservices best practices.

#### Graphics

##### <i>3D techniques</i>
Players can choose to play pong in 3D. We used ThreeJS/WebGL to create the graphics.

#### Accessibility

##### <i>Support on all devices</i>
The website is designed in mobile first, responsive, supported on all devices.

##### <i>Browser compatibility</i>
The website is compatible with at least Chrome, Chrome-based and Firefox.

##### <i>Multiple languages</i>
Players can change the language of the website. The supported languages are English, French, Spanish and Dutch.

##### <i>SSR integration</i>
We integrated Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to enhance the performance and SIO (Search Engine Optimization) of the website.

#### Server-Side Pong

##### <i>Server-side pong</i>
We replaced the basic pong game with a server-side pong game, accompanied by the implementation of an API.

##### <i>CLI</i>
We developed a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to play pong against players using the web version of the game.  

### Out of scope

We added a system of tournament that allows distant players to play together.
Users can pick a theme.
